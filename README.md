## Other

### FAQ

> **How did this idea come about?**

When trying to find ways to get involved on campus, we found it extremely difficult to get connected with organizations related to our interests. We hope this app streamlines the process of discovering clubs and events on campuses across the country.

> **What about future prospective students? Can they access the app?**

Yes, absolutely. Prospective university and high school students will be able to login as a guest to view what clubs and events are at a specific institution. This very could help them make a decision about what school he or she attends.

> **What platforms are supported?**

Both iOS and Android will be supported. Future support for Web may be added later.

> **What languages are supported?**

English is currently the only supported language, however, we understand the importance of multilingual support and will quickly add the languages which we believe have the broadest reach on campuses.

> **How do students create an account and login? Can they use their institution credentials?**

Yes. Any user can login through the app's custom credentials. Alternatively, every user can use sign in with his or her Google or Apple credentials. If an institution wishes to support their credentials, those credentials might also be supported in the future.

> **How does the app validate organizations, organization leaders, and students?**

Every organization leader or event host will receive a unique code to redeem admin privileges for an organization. Organizations can be flagged by students if it does not exist. In addition, students will likely use their institution login or email to use the app.

> **What about Greek Life? Is that considered an organization?**

Yes. This app will be a great way for Greek Life to promote rush events and to host their own internal events.

> **How do you help organization leaders and event hosts upload information?**

There is an easy to use submission form within the app that an organization leader or event host can use to submit information for others to see.

> **Is this only for universities? What about high schools?**

This app will be targeted to both high schools and universities.

> **How do we incentivize organizations to use the app?**

One way in which institutions might incentivize organizations to update the app and to use it would be to qualify for grants and funding. Ensuring that all organizations on campus continuously update their page will allow prospective and current students to best understand the ways to become involved on campus.
